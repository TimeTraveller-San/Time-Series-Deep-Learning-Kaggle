# M5 Forecasting - Accuracy
Guidelines: https://mofc.unic.ac.cy/m5-competition/

- Estimate the point forecasts of the unit sales of various products sold in the USA by Walmart
- In this competition, the fifth iteration, you will use hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the worldâ€™s largest company by revenue, to **forecast daily sales for the next 28 days**. The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy.
- The historical data range from  2011-01-29  to  2016-06-19

# Files
- `calendar.csv` - Contains information about the dates on which the products are sold.
- `sales_train_validation.csv` - Contains the historical daily unit sales data per product and store [d_1 - d_1913]
- `sample_submission.csv` - The correct format for submissions. Reference the Evaluation tab for more info.
- `sell_prices.csv` - Contains information about the price of the products sold per store and date.
- `sales_train_evaluation.csv` - Available once month before competition deadline. Will include sales [d_1 - d_1941]
