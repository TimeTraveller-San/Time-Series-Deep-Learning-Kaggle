# Transformer
`tst` folder is heavily borrowed (with minure changes) from [here](https://github.com/maxjcohen/transformer) which is further borrowed from [here](https://github.com/jadore801120/attention-is-all-you-need-pytorch).

# Note
Everything is just "hacked" together and not cleaned. This code was originally written in jupyter notebooks for a kaggle competition so I had very less time to clean it. This is just for my future references.
